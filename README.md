# test-repo

A repo for the most weird git experiments.

Yet another commit to test squashing commits that are on remote already.

Update `origin/master` on remote 181204-1227

Add a line on local `master` 181204-1231

`README.md`: update `origin/master` on remote 181204-1232 to test `feature` rebase 
on amended file.

Add a change on `master`.
